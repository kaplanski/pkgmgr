# pkgmgr - a lightweight package manager  
  
**pkgmgr** is available at: https://github.com/kaplanski/cpkgmgr  
  
This page currently acts as the repo host.  
Previously the early proof-of-concept bash and  
bash-lite versions of pkgmgr were available here.  
If you are looking for them, they are  
inside the i386/amd64 repos.  

**Building Packages:**  
1. generate an empty package  
2. fill the package  
3. use autobuild.sh to rebuild package index and update repo  
4. push repo
